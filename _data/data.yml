    title: Personal Vision
    summary: |
      Working in the Education sector as the Headmaster of the 5th J. High School of Kalamata, 
      promoting technology through constant adoption of new ideas and directions is my vision of the school community developmnet.
      It is my belief that promoting techology through arts is the hidden secret of bringing people and computers in close relationship
      in a way that the technological or computational world is made softly and calmly hidden from human perception or reality. The Greek word
      Τεχνολογία conveys this hidden characteristic: Τεχνη(ο)λογία 

      
      My teaching experience spans a lifetime of 25 years. I had the opportunity to cooperate in
      the development of the Greek School Network by serving as the Head of the deparmebt of 
      Informatics and New technologies of the Messinia region. The last 7 years I was appointed as a Headmaster in
      Secondary Education Schools.
